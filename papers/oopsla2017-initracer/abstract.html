    <p>
      Event races are a common source of subtle errors in JavaScript web
      applications. Several automated tools for detecting event races
      have been developed, but experiments show that their accuracy is
      generally quite low. We present a new approach that focuses on
      three categories of event race errors that often appear during
      the initialization phase of web applications:
      form-input-overwritten errors, late-event-handler-registration
      errors, and access-before-definition errors. The approach is
      based on a dynamic analysis that uses a combination of adverse
      and approximate execution. Among the strengths of the approach
      are that it does not require browser modifications, expensive
      model checking, or static analysis. 

    <p>
      Modern web applications are written in an event-driven style, in which
      event handlers execute asynchronously in response to user or system
      events. The nondeterminism arising from this programming style can
      lead to pernicious errors. Recent work focuses on detecting event
      races and classifying them as harmful or harmless. However, since
      modifying the source code to prevent harmful races can be a difficult
      and error-prone task, it may be preferable to steer away from the bad
      executions.
