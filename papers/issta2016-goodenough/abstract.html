    <p>
      In dynamically typed programming languages, type errors can occur at
      runtime. Executing the test suites that often accompany programs may
      provide some confidence about absence of such errors, but generally
      without giving any guarantees. We present a program analysis that can
      check whether a test suite has sufficient coverage to prove a given
      type-related property, which is particularly challenging for program
      code with overloading and value dependent types. The analysis achieves
      a synergy between scalable static analysis and dynamic analysis that
      goes beyond what can be accomplished with the static analysis alone.
      Additionally, the analysis provides a new coverage adequacy metric as
      a measure of the completeness of a test suite for a family of
      type-related properties.

    <p>
      Based on an implementation for Dart, we demonstrate how such a hybrid
      static/dynamic program analysis can be used for measuring the quality
      of a test suite with respect to showing absence of type errors and
      inferring sound call graph information, specifically for program code
      that is difficult to handle for traditional static analysis
      techniques.
