    <p>
      Modern web applications are written in an event-driven style, in which
      event handlers execute asynchronously in response to user or system
      events. The nondeterminism arising from this programming style can
      lead to pernicious errors. Recent work focuses on detecting event
      races and classifying them as harmful or harmless. However, since
      modifying the source code to prevent harmful races can be a difficult
      and error-prone task, it may be preferable to steer away from the bad
      executions.

    <p>
      In this paper, we present a technique for automated repair of event
      race errors in JavaScript web applications. Our approach relies on an
      event controller that restricts event handler scheduling in the
      browser according to a specified repair policy, by intercepting and
      carefully postponing or discarding selected events. We have
      implemented the technique in a tool called EventRaceCommander, which relies
      entirely on source code instrumentation, and evaluated it by repairing
      more than 100 event race errors that occur in the web applications
      from the largest 20 of the Fortune 500 companies. Our results show
      that application-independent repair policies usually suffice to repair
      event race errors without excessive negative impact on performance or
      user experience, though application-specific repair policies that
      target specific event races are sometimes desirable.
